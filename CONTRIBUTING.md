## FAQ
1. Where did the logs go?
   - The logs are stored in the `Paifu` folder in the same directory as the executable if you don't specify the path.
   - Use `--output [path]` to specify the path to store the logs.
   - If you used pip to install the PaifuLogger, the logs are stored in the `Paifu` folder where the command line opened.
2. There are new elements in the log file that makes the tables broken.
   - Use `--remake` to remake the log file.
