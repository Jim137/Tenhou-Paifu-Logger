You can manually log the paifu by the following code.

```python
from paifulogger import get_paifu, localized_str, log_paifu
from paifulogger.log import _get_log_func

url = "Your paifu URL"
local_lang = localized_str("en") # Localization
log_formats = _get_log_func(["csv", "html"]) # Log into csv and html file.
output = "./" # Output directory
mjai = False # Whether have output in mjai format

# Log the paifu into the file.
log_paifu(
    url,
    log_formats = log_formats,
    local_lang = local_lang,
    output = output,
    mjai = mjai
)
# Get Paifu object, which contains all the information of the paifu.
paifu = get_paifu(url, local_lang)
```
